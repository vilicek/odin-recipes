    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe
      produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few
      ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much
      better than the boxed stuff).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with
        all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret
        to fluffy pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll
        need for subtly sweet pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor
        without making your pancakes taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk and butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and
        richness to the pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it
        helps bind the pancake batter together.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
